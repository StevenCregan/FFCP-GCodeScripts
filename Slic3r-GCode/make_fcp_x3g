#!/bin/bash
# Does post-processing on G-code files generated by Slic3r, assuming it has been
# configured with my custom G-code snippets.
# 1. Runs the dualstrusion post-processing script if the file has the start
#    G-code for this script.
# 2. Fixes incorrect temperature command for single extrusion prints.
# 3. Optionally runs the MightyVariableFan PWM post-processing script.
# 4. Optionally applies my retraction improver hack.
# 5. Sends the G-code file through GPX to produce an x3g file.
# Should be called with only a single argument: the G-code file.
# Run with -h for usage info (or just look at usage below).
#
# To use with a Windows WSL environment, create a .BAT file containing one line
# as follows, and specify this .BAT file as a post-processing script in Slic3r:
#     bash /your/linux/path/to/make_fcp_x3g -w '%1'

#### Modify the following values to match your setup: ####

# Path to the gpx binary. Try `which gpx` if you're not sure what is the
# correct path.
GPX=/usr/local/bin/gpx

# Run `gpx -?` and look at the 'MACHINE' section. If it lists 'fcp' as one of
# the allowed values, it is preferable to use that value here. Otherwise, use
# 'r1d' instead, or something custom if you know what you're doing.
MACHINE=fcp

# The following settings are optional and will be silently ignored if the paths
# do not point to *executable* files. You don't need to explicitly comment them
# out if you're not using these extra post-processing scripts.

# Path to the dualstrusion post-processing script.
# See https://github.com/DrLex0/DualstrusionPostproc for more information.
DUALSTRUDE_SCRIPT=/Users/athomas/bin/dualstrusion-postproc.pl

# Path to the PWM postprocessor script in case you would be using the
# MightyVariableFan system, my slightly crazy solution to obtain variable fan
# speed by having the FFCP communicate with a Raspberry Pi through beep sounds.
# See https://github.com/DrLex0/MightyVariableFan for more information.
PWM_SCRIPT=/Users/athomas/bin/pwm_postprocessor.py
# Extra options to be passed to the PWM_SCRIPT, for instance you may want to
# change options from their defaults, like --allow_split or --zmax.
#PWM_OPTS='--allow_split'

# Path to the experimental retraction improver script.
# (Note: you probably don't have this script because I haven't released it yet,
# and I'm not sure if I ever will because it is a hideous hack).
#RETRACT_SCRIPT=/Users/athomas/bin/retraction-improver.pl

# Set this to 1 to always keep a backup of the unprocessed gcode file,
# regardless of -k option (useful for debugging).
KEEP_ORIG=0

# Add extra PATH components here, separated by the usual ':'. You'll need this
# in case some of the scripts require an interpreter (e.g. python3) that is not
# in the stripped-down PATH of Slic3r's environment.
EXTRA_PATH='/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin'

# Set this to 1 to run the sanity check before processing a file and write the
# result to a file 'make_fcp_x3g.check'. This is useful to debug problems when
# not all post-processing scripts seem to work when invoking make_fcp_x3g from
# within Slic3r or other programs.
