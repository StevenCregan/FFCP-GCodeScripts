# G-code For Use W/Flashforge Creator Pro

This repository contains several things:
* Octoprint G-code scripts
* Simplify3D G-code scripts
* Slic3r G-Code and Post-Processing scripts

## G-code Scripts
Aggregated here are some gcode snippets for use with Octoprint, Simplify3d, and also Slic3r

This was originally a repository by @DrLex0 and the Slic3r scripts can all be attributed to them

## Contibutions
Feel free to open issues/pull requests if you have scripts you'd like added or changed

Hopefully we can increase the number of compatible slicers available.

Please be sure that you comment lines in your gcode before creating a pull request, for readability and accessibility
